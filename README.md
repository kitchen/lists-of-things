This repo contains names of things.

Over the years I've had many naming schemes for things. Lunar seas, celestial bodies, names of cities, etc.
I think I do this because sometimes it's fun to list things that I can remember, like airports I've flown through or huts I've stayed at in New Zealand.
But I haven't really *settled* on a scheme in a long time. Something new always comes up. Usually it's a pivot from a previous scheme, but sometimes I only use the scheme for a few things.
I used to try to keep a list of the naming scheme and what things are so I don't have conflicts, but lately I just don't care.
But I think I would like to think of the lists!

So here it is. A bunch of random lists and why they are significant to me.
