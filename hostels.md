Hostels I've stayed at around the world

For "hostel" here I'm counting any sort of hostel or hostel-like place, bunkhouse, "backpacker" etc. Unless I had a private ensuite room in which case it's just a hotel. Looking at you, Te Anau Kiwi Holiday Park ;-)

# United States

* Northwest Portland HI Hostel
* Green Tortoise Seattle

# Canada

* Ocean Island Inn - Victoria
* HI Vancouver Downtown

# Japan

Capsule Hotels and Minshuku I think should get their own category. Minshuku can have private or shared rooms, so they could be hostel-y, but both of the ones I stayed at were private rooms.
